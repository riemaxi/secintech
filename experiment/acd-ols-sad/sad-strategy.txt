Each task has been assigned:
- time slot
- memory
- priority

The schedule will select a group of tasks to execute fpr a time period > time slot
**********************************************************************************

- Given: task oriented implementation offered by espressif
- find the best task schedule to deliver (time, memory, priority for each task)

 - commands from the OLS representative on OLC to SAD (a task attending k relay channels)
 - do planned deployment (a task sending chuncks of bytes to the flash memory and rebooting when all the data is transferred)
 - notify SAD messages to OLS
 - setting command from OLS representative on OLC
	State notification frequency
	Device parameters
