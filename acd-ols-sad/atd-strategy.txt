*************************************************************************
task oriented programming is about structuring a program in terms of tasks
Each task has been assigned:
- time slot
- memory
- priority

The schedule will select a group of tasks to execute fpr a time period > time slot
**********************************************************************************

- Given: task oriented implementation offered by espressif
- find the best task schedule to deliver (time, memory, priority for each task)

 - do planned deployment (a task sending chuncks of bytes to the flash memory and rebooting when all the data is transferred)
 - notify WatchDog signal to ATD representative on OLC
 - setting command from ATD representative on OLC
	State notification frequency
	Device parameters 
	Anomaly pattern detector (software)
